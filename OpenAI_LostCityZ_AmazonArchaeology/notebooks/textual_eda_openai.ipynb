    "    You could add it to a configuration file that is **NOT** committed to version control. For instance, you could create a separate `~/.openai_config.ini` or add it to your main `config.ini` under a specific section, ensuring this file is in your `.gitignore`.\n",

    "1.  **Clear Instructions:** The prompt explicitly asks the model to identify entities and provide the text segment and type. It also specifies the desired JSON output format.\n",
    "2.  **Entity Definitions:** Providing a brief description for each entity type (as done in `entity_definitions` and then passed to the prompt, though not fully shown in the example `extract_entities_with_openai` function above but implied by `entity_types.keys()` and `entity_types_example`) can help the model understand the nuances, especially for domain-specific terms.\n",
    "3.  **Examples in Prompt (Few-Shot Learning):** The example `entity_types_example` (which ideally should be constructed from `entity_definitions`) gives the model a concrete idea of the output structure. For more complex cases, providing a full example of an input text and its corresponding desired JSON output within the prompt can significantly improve accuracy. This is known as few-shot prompting.\n",
    "4.  **System Message:** The system message `\"You are an expert in Amazonian archaeology and history...\"` helps set the context and persona for the model.\n",
    "5.  **Iterative Refinement:** If the initial results are not satisfactory (e.g., missed entities, incorrect classifications), the prompt should be refined. This could involve:\n",
    "    *   Making entity definitions more precise.\n",
    "    *   Adding more varied examples to the prompt.\n",
    "    *   Specifying what *not* to extract if certain patterns are consistently misidentified.\n",
    "    *   Breaking down very long texts into smaller chunks if context window limits are an issue or if performance degrades.\n",
    "6.  **JSON Output Format:** Using `response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}` (for compatible models like gpt-3.5-turbo-1106+ and gpt-4-turbo-preview) is highly recommended as it forces the model to output valid JSON, reducing parsing errors. If using older models, more robust parsing of the string output (which might not be perfect JSON) would be needed.\n",
    "7.  **Temperature:** A lower temperature (e.g., 0.0 to 0.3) makes the output more focused and deterministic, which is usually desirable for extraction tasks."

    "## 7. Summary of EDA with OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated initial explorations using OpenAI models for several NLP tasks on sample textual data relevant to Amazonian archaeology:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**\n",
    "    *   Successfully extracted entities like Place Names, Indigenous Groups, Settlement/Structure descriptions, Resources, etc., based on tailored prompts.\n",
    "    *   The quality of extraction depends heavily on prompt clarity, entity definitions, and potentially few-shot examples for more nuanced cases.\n",
    "    *   Using the JSON response format is beneficial for structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Topic Modeling (Conceptual Thematic Summarization):**\n",
    "    *   Models were able to provide high-level thematic summaries and associate documents with these themes.\n",
    "    *   This approach is good for quickly understanding a small corpus but isn't a replacement for rigorous statistical topic modeling on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Relationship Extraction:**\n",
    "    *   Showed potential for identifying simple relationships between entities (e.g., Group-Location, Group-Resource).\n",
    "    *   Prompt design is critical here, and the task is inherently more complex than NER. Output might require more careful validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Geocoding/Disambiguation (Conceptual):**\n",
    "    *   Demonstrated how models can be prompted to reason about ambiguous locations based on textual context.\n",
    "    *   The accuracy and utility depend on the model's underlying knowledge base and the specificity of the context provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Challenges & Considerations:**\n",
    "*   **Prompt Engineering:** Achieving desired results is an iterative process of refining prompts, providing clear definitions, and good examples.\n",
    "*   **Model Choice:** Newer models (GPT-4 series) might offer better reasoning and adherence to complex instructions but come at a higher cost. GPT-3.5-turbo is a good starting point.\n",
    "*   **Cost:** Processing large volumes of text or making many complex calls can become expensive. Strategies like processing only new/updated texts, using smaller models for simpler tasks, or sampling data might be needed.\n",
    "*   **Output Variability & Validation:** While temperature can be lowered for more deterministic output, some variability can still exist. Extracted information, especially relationships and geocoding suggestions, needs careful review and validation against other sources.\n",
    "*   **Context Window Limits:** Very long documents might need to be chunked for processing, which could affect context available for extraction or summarization tasks.\n",
    "*   **Rate Limits:** Be mindful of API rate limits and implement appropriate backoff/retry strategies for larger batch jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How these AI-driven insights can feed into broader archaeological search:**\n",
    "*   **NER outputs** directly provide structured data (place names, site types, group names, resources) that can be mapped, cataloged, and used to query other datasets (e.g., find LiDAR data for an extracted `ARCHAEOLOGICAL_SITE`).\n",
    "*   **Thematic summaries** can help categorize documents and prioritize those most relevant to specific research questions (e.g., finding all texts discussing riverine agriculture).\n",
    "*   **Extracted relationships** can build knowledge graphs, showing connections between peoples, places, and practices, which might reveal patterns or areas for further investigation.\n",
    "*   **Geocoding assistance** can help translate textual descriptions into spatial hypotheses, guiding field surveys or remote sensing analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These OpenAI-driven techniques offer powerful tools to augment traditional textual analysis, enabling faster extraction of key information and generation of new hypotheses from historical and archaeological texts."
