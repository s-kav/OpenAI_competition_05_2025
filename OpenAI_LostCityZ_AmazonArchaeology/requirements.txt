# OCR (Optional, ensure Tesseract engine and Poppler are also installed system-wide if using)
# These are conditional imports in the script, so not strictly required if OCR isn't used.
# However, listing them helps if OCR features are to be tested.
pytesseract>=0.3.8
Pillow>=8.4.0  # PIL, a dependency for pytesseract and pdf2image
pdf2image>=1.16.0

# Note: 
# GDAL and PDAL (the core libraries/executables) often require system-level installation 
# (e.g., via conda, apt, or OS-specific installers) rather than just pip.
# The Python packages 'gdal' and 'pdal' listed here are typically their Python bindings.
# For Conda environments, these are often bundled correctly.
# Ensure Tesseract OCR engine and Poppler utilities are installed if using OCR features.
