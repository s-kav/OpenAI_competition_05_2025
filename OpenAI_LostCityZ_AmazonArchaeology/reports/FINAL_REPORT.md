## Abstract / Executive Summary

This project addresses the challenge of identifying potential archaeological sites within a designated Amazonian Area of Interest (AOI) by leveraging a multi-faceted approach that integrates open-source geospatial data, historical textual sources, and advanced AI methodologies. The primary objective was to develop a systematic and reproducible workflow for pinpointing and prioritizing Potential Interest Zones (PIZs) that may harbor remnants of past human activity.

The methodology encompassed several phases:
1.  **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collection and preparation of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, LiDAR data, and diverse textual documents (historical accounts, academic papers). Standardized pipelines were developed for tasks such as atmospheric correction, cloud masking, DTM generation, and text extraction/cleaning.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering:** Each data type was analyzed to identify anomalous patterns and features indicative of archaeological sites. This involved calculating spectral indices and textural features from satellite data, deriving various topographic visualizations (hillshades, slope, aspect) from LiDAR DTMs, and utilizing OpenAI LLMs for Named Entity Recognition, thematic analysis, and contextual understanding of textual data.
3.  **PIZ Identification & Scoring:** A multi-source evidence convergence strategy was implemented. Anomalies and insights from the EDA phase were spatially referenced and overlaid to define PIZs. A heuristic scoring system, based on the strength, type, and convergence of evidence from different data sources, was used to rank these PIZs.
4.  **AI-Assisted Plausibility Assessment & Verification Strategy:** OpenAI models were conceptually integrated to assess the archaeological plausibility of high-scoring PIZs by synthesizing evidence and generating hypotheses. A comprehensive verification strategy involving cross-data corroboration, comparative analysis with known sites, and historical map overlays was defined to increase confidence in candidate sites.

This project framework is designed to produce a ranked list of PIZs, each accompanied by a detailed dossier summarizing the supporting evidence. While this report primarily details the methodology and an illustrative example of a candidate site, the approach demonstrates significant investigative ingenuity through the synergistic use of diverse datasets and the novel application of AI, particularly LLMs, in interpreting complex, often ambiguous, archaeological indicators. The entire workflow is structured for reproducibility, providing a valuable toolkit for future AI-driven archaeological remote sensing in challenging environments like the Amazon.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. The Enduring Enigma: Amazonian Archaeology and the "Lost City of Z"

The Amazon basin, with its immense biodiversity and dense forest cover, has long concealed the true extent and nature of its pre-Columbian human history. While early European explorers recounted tales of large populations and complex societies, these were often dismissed, contributing to the myth of a "pristine wilderness." The legendary "Lost City of Z," popularized by explorers like Percy Fawcett, epitomizes the allure and mystery of Amazonian archaeology, inspiring generations to seek evidence of advanced civilizations hidden beneath the canopy. Modern archaeology, aided by remote sensing technologies, has begun to dismantle the "pristine" myth, revealing extensive evidence of large-scale earthworks, agricultural systems, and complex settlement patterns, indicating that parts of the Amazon supported substantial populations with sophisticated landscape management practices. However, the sheer scale of the basin and the challenges of ground access mean that vast areas remain archaeologically unexplored.

### 1.2. Project Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to leverage publicly available open-source data and advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to identify and rank Potential Interest Zones (PIZs) that are likely to contain archaeological sites within a specified Area of Interest (AOI) in the Amazon.

Secondary objectives include:
*   Developing a reproducible, multi-stage data processing and analysis pipeline for integrating diverse geospatial and textual datasets.
*   Demonstrating the effective use of satellite imagery (Sentinel-2), LiDAR data, and historical/academic texts for archaeological prospection.
*   Exploring and showcasing the utility of AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) from OpenAI, in various stages of the workflow, including textual data analysis, evidence synthesis, and hypothesis generation.
*   Providing a robust, evidence-based framework for prioritizing PIZs for further investigation.
*   Contributing to the ongoing effort to understand the depth and complexity of Amazonian pre-Columbian societies.

## 3. Data Preprocessing

Detailed preprocessing workflows are documented in `DATA_ACQUISITION_PREPROCESSING_WORKFLOWS.md`. Scripts are located in the `scripts/` subdirectories.

### 3.1. LiDAR Data Preprocessing
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Format Conversion (LAZ to LAS):** If input is LAZ, conversion to LAS using `laspy` (as implemented in `scripts/lidar_pipeline/preprocess_lidar.py`) or PDAL.
    2.  **Ground Point Classification:** Separation of ground returns from non-ground (vegetation, buildings) using PDAL pipelines (e.g., SMRF, PMF, CSF filters as defined in `config/config.ini`). This is critical for DTM generation.
    3.  **Reprojection:** Ensuring data is in a consistent projected CRS (defined in `config/config.ini`) suitable for the AOI using PDAL.
    4.  **DTM Generation:** Creation of Digital Terrain Models (GeoTIFF raster format) from classified ground points using PDAL (`writers.gdal`), with configurable resolution and interpolation methods.
    5.  **Hillshade Generation:** Production of hillshade rasters from DTMs using GDAL (via `rasterio` or `subprocess` calls to `gdaldem`) for visualization. Multi-directional hillshades are often generated.
    6.  **Clipping to AOI:** Final DTMs and hillshades are clipped to the project AOI.
*   **Tools and Libraries:** PDAL, GDAL, `laspy`, `rasterio`, `geopandas`.
*   **Reference Script:** `scripts/lidar_pipeline/preprocess_lidar.py`.

### 3.2. Satellite Imagery Preprocessing
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Atmospheric Correction Verification:** Ensuring Level-2A (surface reflectance) products are used. If Level-1C data were the only option, atmospheric correction (e.g., using `sen2cor`) would be applied (this project prioritizes direct L2A use).
    2.  **Cloud Masking:** Application of cloud, shadow, and cirrus masks using the Scene Classification Layer (SCL) provided with Sentinel-2 L2A products. Alternative methods like `s2cloudless` were considered.
    3.  **Band Selection & Mosaicking:** Selection of specified spectral bands (e.g., Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIRs as per `config/config.ini`). Mosaicking of multiple tiles if the AOI spans across them (using GDAL or `rasterio.merge`).
    4.  **Resampling (Optional):** If combining with other datasets of different resolutions, resampling might be performed, though this project primarily uses bands at their native or a common target resolution (e.g., 10m).
    5.  **Clipping to AOI:** Final processed rasters are clipped to the project AOI.
*   **Tools and Libraries:** `rasterio`, `rioxarray`, `xarray`, GDAL.
*   **Reference Script:** `scripts/satellite_pipeline/preprocess_sentinel2.py`.

### 3.3. Textual Data Preprocessing
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Format Conversion to Plain Text:**
        *   PDFs: Conversion of text-based PDFs to plain text using `pdfminer.six`.
        *   HTML: Main content extraction from HTML files using `trafilatura` (done during acquisition but can be refined).
    2.  **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** For image-based PDFs or scanned documents, OCR using Tesseract (via `pytesseract`) is implemented. This requires prior conversion of PDF pages to images (e.g., using `pdf2image` which depends on Poppler).
    3.  **Text Cleaning:** Application of cleaning routines including:
        *   Unicode normalization and fixing encoding errors (e.g., using `ftfy`).
        *   Normalization of whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).
        *   Optional conversion to lowercase.
        *   Removal of custom-defined irrelevant characters or patterns (via regex in `config/config.ini`).
    4.  **Language Identification:** Detection of the primary language of each document using `langdetect`, with the language code saved to a sidecar file.
*   **Tools and Libraries:** `trafilatura`, `pdfminer.six`, `pytesseract` (with Tesseract OCR engine), `Pillow`, `pdf2image` (with Poppler), `ftfy`, `langdetect`, `re`.
*   **Reference Script:** `scripts/text_pipeline/preprocess_texts.py`.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was crucial for understanding the characteristics of each dataset, identifying potential archaeological indicators, and informing feature engineering for the site prediction model. Detailed EDA processes and findings are documented in the respective Jupyter Notebooks and their accompanying reports.

### 4.1. LiDAR EDA Findings
*   **Process:** Visual inspection of DTMs and derived products (hillshades from multiple azimuths, slope, aspect, contour maps) for a sample AOI using `notebooks/lidar_eda.ipynb`.
*   **Key Insights:**
    *   Multi-directional hillshades were highly effective in revealing subtle topographic features (potential mounds, linear depressions, earthworks) often invisible in standard DTM displays.
    *   Slope maps highlighted sharp breaks indicative of artificial edges or embankments.
    *   Contour maps helped visualize the shape and extent of raised features.
    *   The EDA confirmed the necessity of using a projected CRS for meaningful DTM analysis and visualization.
*   **Reference:** `notebooks/lidar_eda.ipynb`, `lidar_eda_report.md`.

### 4.2. Satellite Imagery EDA Findings
*   **Process:** Analysis of processed Sentinel-2 imagery using `notebooks/satellite_eda.ipynb`, including generation of true/false color composites and various spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, BSI, Simple Ratio).
*   **Key Insights:**
    *   False Color Composites (NIR-R-G) were effective in distinguishing vegetation health and types.
    *   NDVI helped identify areas with anomalous vegetation patterns (unusual stress or vigor) that might correlate with underlying anthropogenic soil modifications (e.g., "terra preta") or buried structures.
    *   NDWI was useful for delineating water bodies, soil moisture variations, and potential paleochannels or ancient water management features.
    *   BSI (where SWIR bands were available) showed potential for identifying areas of exposed soil or distinct soil compositions.
*   **Reference:** `notebooks/satellite_eda.ipynb`, `satellite_eda_report.md`.

### 4.3. Textual Data EDA with OpenAI
*   **Process:** Application of OpenAI LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4) via API calls in `notebooks/textual_eda_openai.ipynb` to sample processed texts. Tasks included:
    *   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Extracting custom entities like `ARCHAEOLOGICAL_SITE`, `INDIGENOUS_GROUP`, `SETTLEMENT_STRUCTURE`, `PLACE_NAME`, `DATE_TIME_PERIOD`, `RESOURCE_MENTION`, `ARTIFACT`.
    *   **Conceptual Topic Modeling:** Identifying main themes and keywords across documents.
    *   **Relationship Extraction:** Identifying relationships between entities (e.g., group located near place).
    *   **Geocoding/Disambiguation Assistance:** Using textual context to suggest potential locations for ambiguous place names.
*   **Key Insights:**
    *   OpenAI models proved effective for rapidly extracting relevant entities from unstructured text with appropriate prompt engineering.
    *   Thematic summarization provided a quick overview of document collections.
    *   Relationship extraction and geocoding showed promise but require careful prompting and validation.
    *   This AI-driven EDA significantly enhances the ability to convert qualitative textual data into structured, spatially relevant information.
*   **Reference:** `notebooks/textual_eda_openai.ipynb`, `textual_eda_openai_report.md`.

### 4.4. How EDA Informed Feature Engineering and Site Prediction
*   **LiDAR:** Identified topographic feature types (mounds, linear features, geometric shapes) and their characteristics (size, clarity) became key inputs for defining LiDAR anomalies and scoring PIZs. The effectiveness of certain hillshade angles informed visualization strategies.
*   **Satellite:** Specific spectral index thresholds or ranges defining anomalies (e.g., unusually low/high NDVI) and distinct patterns (e.g., geometric vegetation clearings) were identified as satellite-derived features.
*   **Textual:** Extracted named entities (especially `ARCHAEOLOGICAL_SITE`, `PLACE_NAME`, `SETTLEMENT_STRUCTURE`) provided geocodable points of interest and keywords. Thematic analysis helped categorize texts for relevance.
*   **Strategy Reference:** `EDA_FEATURE_ENGINEERING_STRATEGY.md`.

## 5. Site Prediction Methodology

The site prediction methodology aims to integrate insights from the EDA phase to identify and rank Potential Interest Zones (PIZs). This is detailed in `SITE_PREDICTION_VERIFICATION_STRATEGY.md` and implemented in `notebooks/piz_identification_scoring.ipynb`.

### 5.1. Identification of Potential Interest Zones (PIZs)
*   **Multi-Source Evidence Convergence:** PIZs are defined by the spatial convergence of anomalies or features identified from LiDAR, satellite imagery, and textual data.
*   **Methodology (Buffer-and-Overlap):**
    1.  **Buffering:** Anomalies from each data source (represented as points or polygons) are buffered to account for spatial uncertainty (e.g., 200m buffer for remote sensing anomalies, potentially larger for textual mentions).
    2.  **Aggregation & Dissolving:** All buffered geometries are combined. Overlapping buffers are dissolved to form larger, contiguous zones.
    3.  **Characterization:** Each dissolved zone is analyzed to identify the original (unbuffered) anomalies that intersect it and count the number of unique data source types contributing.
    4.  **PIZ Finalization:** Zones with evidence from a minimum number of source types (e.g., at least one or two) are designated as PIZs.
*   **Output:** A GeoDataFrame of PIZ polygons, each attributed with information about the contributing evidence from different sources.

### 5.2. Heuristic Scoring System
A heuristic (knowledge-based) scoring system is used to rank PIZs due to the likely scarcity of comprehensive labeled training data for supervised machine learning in this context.
*   **Scoring Parameters & Example Weights:**
    *   `num_sources`: Number of unique data types contributing (Weight: 3.0).
    *   `lidar_clarity_max`: Maximum clarity score (1-5) of LiDAR anomalies within the PIZ (Weight: 2.0).
    *   `satellite_significance_max`: Maximum significance score (1-5) of satellite anomalies (Weight: 2.0).
    *   `textual_reliability_max`: Maximum reliability score (1-5) of textual mentions (Weight: 1.5).
    *   `proximity_to_water`: Bonus if PIZ is near a water source (Weight: 0.5).
    *   *(Other parameters like uniqueness, size, specific feature types can be added).*
*   **Calculation:** `PIZ_Score = Σ (Parameter_Score * Weight)`.
*   **Output:** A ranked list of PIZs with their scores and contributing evidence, saved as GeoJSON and CSV.

### 5.3. Role of OpenAI in Textual Analysis for PIZ Context
*   **Entity Extraction for Geocoding:** Geocoded entities (Place Names, Archaeological Sites) extracted by OpenAI during textual EDA serve as spatial points that can contribute to PIZ formation if other remote sensing anomalies are nearby.
*   **Plausibility Assessment (Conceptual):** For top-scoring PIZs, OpenAI models (e.g., GPT-4) can be used to assess archaeological plausibility. The `piz_identification_scoring.ipynb` notebook includes functions to formulate detailed prompts that feed a summary of a PIZ's evidence (LiDAR, satellite, textual features, score) to an LLM. The LLM is asked to:
    *   Suggest potential site types in an Amazonian context.
    *   Consider alternative (non-archaeological) explanations.
    *   Assess the strength of evidence and identify gaps.
    *   Propose further investigation steps.
    This provides a qualitative, AI-assisted "second opinion" and helps generate hypotheses.

## 6. Site Verification Methodology

For the top N candidate PIZs identified, a verification process is crucial to increase confidence in their archaeological potential. The detailed procedures are outlined in `PIZ_VERIFICATION_PROCEDURES.md`.

### 6.1. Overview of Verification Strategy
The strategy emphasizes using at least two independent methods to assess each high-scoring PIZ. Verification aims to corroborate initial findings and critically evaluate the nature of the identified anomalies.

### 6.2. Method 1: Cross-Data Corroboration & Detailed Multi-Source Re-Analysis
*   **Procedure:** Involves a focused re-examination of all available data types (LiDAR, satellite, textual, historical maps) specifically for the PIZ's micro-AOI. This may include re-processing data with different parameters for that small area (e.g., generating new DTM derivatives, alternative spectral indices, targeted keyword searches in texts).
*   **Goal:** To find converging lines of evidence from different sources that spatially align and support an anthropogenic origin for the features within the PIZ.

### 6.3. Method 2: Comparative Analysis with Known Archaeological Sites (Literature-Based)
*   **Procedure:** The morphological characteristics, size, layout, and environmental setting of features within the PIZ are systematically compared to documented archaeological sites in the Amazon or similar tropical environments, using academic literature, site reports, and image databases of known sites.
*   **Goal:** To determine if the PIZ features fit known patterns of Amazonian archaeological manifestations, aiding in their interpretation and plausibility assessment.

### 6.4. (Optional) Other Verification Methods Applied
*   **Consulting External Databases/Experts:** Checking PIZ locations against non-competition public databases (with ethical considerations) or seeking general advice from domain experts on observed feature types.
*   **Environmental/Simulation Modeling:** Assessing site suitability through hydrological modeling, visibility analysis, or resource proximity modeling based on DTMs and other environmental data.
*   **Advanced Remote Sensing Analysis:** Applying specialized techniques like texture analysis or OBIA to the PIZ if initial methods are inconclusive.

### 6.5. Documentation of Verification Results
For each verified PIZ, a structured record is maintained, detailing: PIZ ID, original score, methods applied, data/tools used, detailed findings for each method (with visual evidence), an overall verification summary, a confidence assessment (High, Medium, Low), and recommendations for future action. This forms part of the Site Dossier (see Section 7).

## 7. Results: Candidate Archaeological Sites (Illustrative Example)

This section presents how top candidate PIZs would be documented and summarized. The following is an **illustrative example** based on the `EXAMPLE_CANDIDATE_SITE_DOSSIER.md`, demonstrating the type of information compiled for a high-potential site. *Actual findings would depend on the real data for the AOI.*

### 7.1. Overview of Prioritized PIZs
*(This subsection would typically provide a brief overview, e.g., "A total of X PIZs were identified. The top Y PIZs, with scores ranging from A to B, were selected for detailed presentation and verification. These sites are primarily located in [general regions of AOI, e.g., interfluvial zones, along major river terraces].")*
For this draft, we present one detailed example.

    *   **Measurements:** Feature L1 (Main Mound): Diameter `~30m`, Height `~2-2.5m`; Feature L2 (Linear Depression): Length `~70m`.

**4. Satellite Imagery Evidence:**
    *   **Description of Anomalies:** `The area directly overlying the main LiDAR mound (L1) exhibits a distinct, roughly circular patch of anomalous vegetation signature in Sentinel-2 imagery (low NDVI values ~0.55 compared to surrounding forest ~0.80-0.85; altered False Color Composite tone). This is persistent across multiple dry season images (2018-2023) and suggests long-term impact on soil or vegetation.`
    *   **Key Visualizations (Paths to Image Files):**
        *   False Color Composite: `reports/site_dossiers/images/piz001_satellite_falsecolor.png`
        *   NDVI Map: `reports/site_dossiers/images/piz001_ndvi_map.png`

**5. Textual Evidence:**
    *   **Relevant Excerpts:** Journal of Explorer Alvares Cabral Jr., 1788: `"...two days journey upriver from the great falls of the Rio Esperança, we passed a village of the Yano people. Their dwellings were modest, but nearby, upon raised earth like a small hill, stood their main longhouse, surrounded by what appeared to be an old ditch on one side... They spoke of it being an ancient place of their forefathers."`
    *   **NER Output Summary:** Place Names: `Rio Esperança`; Dates: `1788`; Groups: `Yano people`; Structures: `village`, `raised earth`, `small hill`, `main longhouse`, `old ditch`.
    *   **OpenAI-Assisted Summary:** `An 18th-century explorer's journal describes a Yano village near the Rio Esperança featuring a significant longhouse on "raised earth" with an "old ditch," referred to by the Yano as an "ancient place," suggesting long-term landscape modification.`

**6. Spatial Overlays and Convergence of Evidence:**
    *   **Description:** `The LiDAR mound (L1) and ditch (L2) align spatially with the circular low NDVI satellite anomaly (S1). The geocoded buffer for the textual mention of the "Yano village on raised earth" significantly overlaps this PIZ.`
    *   **Key Map:** `reports/site_dossiers/images/piz001_evidence_overlay_map.png`
    *   **Table of Converging Evidence:** (As presented in `EXAMPLE_CANDIDATE_SITE_DOSSIER.md`)

**7. AI-Generated Synthesis and Insights (Illustrative):**
    *   **Synthesized Narrative of Potential Archaeological Nature:** `(Based on example prompt in EXAMPLE_CANDIDATE_SITE_DOSSIER.md) PIZ-001 strongly suggests a pre-Columbian archaeological site with a prominent circular earthmound (~30m diameter, 2-2.5m high), a smaller mound, and a ~70m linear depression (likely a ditch). LiDAR data clearly shows these non-natural modifications. Sentinel-2 imagery reveals a persistent, spatially coincident low-NDVI vegetation anomaly over the main mound, indicating long-term environmental impact. A 1788 historical text describes a Yano village in this vicinity with a longhouse on "raised earth" and an "old ditch," matching observed features and termed an "ancient place." The convergence of LiDAR, satellite, and textual evidence points to a potentially fortified or ceremonial mound site with possible multi-period occupation.`
    *   **Potential Historical Interpretations and New Hypotheses:** `(Based on example prompt in EXAMPLE_CANDIDATE_SITE_DOSSIER.md) The site could be a fortified village or chiefly mound, consistent with Arawak, Carib, or Tupi-Guarani earthwork traditions. The "ancient place" reference by the 18th-century Yano people suggests potential reoccupation of an older site. The NDVI anomaly hints at Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE), indicating intensive habitation and soil management. Hypotheses include: 1. Multi-component site with earlier mound-builders and later Yano occupation. 2. Strategic landscape engineering for resource access and defense. Research questions focus on chronology, soil composition, site function, and regional settlement patterns.`

**8. Overall Assessment and Confidence (Illustrative):**
    *   **Summary Interpretation:** `PIZ-001 represents a high-probability pre-Columbian settlement, likely a mound-builder site with defensive/ceremonial features, with evidence of historical indigenous knowledge/reoccupation.`
    *   **Confidence in Archaeological Potential:** `High`

**9. Recommendations for Next Steps (Illustrative):**
    *   `Prioritize for advanced remote sensing analysis (e.g., detailed DTM derivatives). Strong candidate for simulated fieldwork planning. Further textual research on "Yano people" and "great falls of Rio Esperança".`

## 8. Discussion (Initial Draft)

### 8.1. Interpretation of Findings: Advancing Amazonian History (Archaeological Impact)
This project's methodology, by systematically integrating diverse remote sensing and textual datasets augmented by AI, aims to identify multiple Potential Interest Zones (PIZs) that could represent previously undocumented archaeological sites. If even a fraction of the high-scoring PIZs identified through this process were to be confirmed as genuine archaeological sites through future research, it would contribute significantly to:
*   Expanding the known distribution of pre-Columbian settlements and landscape modifications in the Amazon.
*   Understanding the diversity of site types, social organization, and adaptation strategies across different Amazonian sub-regions.
*   Refining models of population density and societal complexity in pre-Columbian Amazonia.
*   Providing new targets for focused archaeological research and conservation efforts.
The systematic approach allows for a more comprehensive survey of the AOI than might be possible through traditional methods alone.

### 8.2. Investigative Ingenuity
The ingenuity of this project lies in:
*   **Multi-Source Data Fusion:** The core strategy relies on the convergence of evidence from disparate sources (topographic data from LiDAR, spectral/vegetation data from Sentinel-2, historical/ethnographic clues from texts), recognizing that no single data type holds all the answers.
*   **AI Integration Across the Workflow:**
    *   **Textual Analysis:** Using OpenAI LLMs for NER, thematic analysis, relationship extraction, and geocoding assistance transforms qualitative textual data into more structured, queryable, and spatially relevant information. This unlocks the potential of vast textual archives for archaeological prospection.
    *   **Evidence Synthesis & Hypothesis Generation:** Conceptually employing LLMs to synthesize complex, multi-source evidence for top PIZs and to help generate plausible interpretations and new research questions demonstrates a novel approach to augmenting human archaeological reasoning.
*   **Heuristic Scoring for Prioritization:** The development of a transparent, adaptable heuristic scoring system allows for logical prioritization of PIZs in a context where supervised machine learning for site prediction is often hampered by limited training data.
*   **Structured Verification:** The emphasis on verifying PIZs using multiple independent methods before drawing firm conclusions.

### 8.3. Novelty of Findings or Methods
*   **Methodological Novelty:** While individual techniques (LiDAR analysis, satellite remote sensing, textual analysis) are established, the novelty lies in their systematic integration within a structured pipeline where AI plays a significant role at multiple stages, particularly in processing and interpreting textual data at scale and in assisting with the synthesis of multi-layered evidence. The specific combination of EDA outputs feeding into a heuristic scoring system that then informs AI-assisted plausibility assessment is a novel workflow for this context.
*   **Potential for Novel Findings:** The application of this comprehensive methodology to a potentially under-researched AOI has the potential to identify site typologies or distributions that are not yet well-documented, or to find sites in unexpected environmental settings. The AI's ability to process large textual datasets might also uncover previously overlooked connections or site descriptions. *(Actual novelty of findings depends on real data and results).*

### 8.4. Limitations of the Study
*   **Data Availability and Quality:** The success is contingent on the availability and quality of open-source LiDAR, Sentinel-2, and textual data for the AOI. Gaps in LiDAR coverage, persistent cloud cover in satellite imagery, or scarcity of relevant historical texts for specific sub-regions can limit detection capabilities. The resolution of Sentinel-2 (10-20m) restricts the detection of smaller features.
*   **Preprocessing Challenges:** Automated preprocessing pipelines can introduce errors (e.g., imperfect cloud masking, DTM artifacts from dense vegetation).
*   **Heuristic Scoring Subjectivity:** The weights and parameters in the heuristic scoring system have an element of subjectivity and require careful calibration and justification.
*   **AI Model Limitations:**
    *   **LLM "Hallucinations":** OpenAI models can sometimes generate plausible but incorrect information. All AI-generated insights require critical human review and validation against primary evidence.
    *   **Prompt Dependency:** The quality of AI outputs is highly dependent on prompt engineering.
    *   **Bias in Training Data:** LLMs are trained on vast datasets, which may contain historical or cultural biases present in the textual sources themselves.
    *   **Cost:** Extensive use of advanced OpenAI models can incur significant costs.
*   **Verification Constraints:** This project focuses on remote identification and verification. Definitive confirmation of sites and their characteristics requires ground-truthing (survey and excavation), which is outside the scope.
*   **Indirect Detection:** Most evidence is indirect (e.g., vegetation anomalies, topographic modifications). Direct detection of artifacts or structures is generally not possible with the sensors used.

### 8.5. Future Work and Potential for Ground-Truthing
*   **Refinement of Scoring Model:** Iteratively tune the heuristic scoring model based on verification results and expert feedback. Explore incorporating more quantitative features.
*   **Machine Learning (if data permits):** If sufficient labeled data (verified sites and non-sites) becomes available, develop and train a supervised machine learning model for site prediction.
*   **Expanded AI Integration:** Further explore LLMs for tasks like automated comparison of PIZ features with literature descriptions, or generating more detailed simulated fieldwork plans.
*   **Application to New AOIs:** The developed workflow can be adapted and applied to other regions in the Amazon or similar environments.
*   **Ground-Truthing Prioritization:** The ranked list of verified PIZs provides a scientifically-grounded basis for prioritizing areas for future archaeological fieldwork, should such opportunities arise. This project can directly inform where limited field resources could be most productively allocated.

    *   **Copernicus Hub/PEPS Credentials:** Users must register and enter their credentials in the `config/config.ini` file for Sentinel-2 data acquisition.
    *   *(The submitted `config.ini` will have placeholder values for these credentials.)*

### 9.3. Step-by-Step Instructions to Run the Entire Pipeline
*(This section will be finalized with precise commands and checks based on the fully tested pipeline.)*

1.  **Clone Repository:** `git clone [repository_url]`
2.  **Set Up Environment:**
    *   Using Conda: `conda env create -f environment.yml` followed by `conda activate amazon_archaeology_env` (example env name).
    *   Or using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (ensure GDAL/PDAL are correctly installed system-wide if not using Conda for them).
3.  **Configure `config/config.ini`:**
    *   Update API credentials (OpenAI, Copernicus Hub).
    *   Define the AOI (e.g., update `aoi_bbox` or `aoi_geojson_path`).
    *   Review and adjust date ranges, cloud cover, processing parameters, URLs for textual data, etc., as needed for the target AOI or specific datasets.
4.  **Run Data Acquisition & Preprocessing Scripts (from the `OpenAI_LostCityZ_AmazonArchaeology/` root directory):**
    *   `python scripts/satellite_pipeline/acquire_sentinel2.py`
    *   `python scripts/satellite_pipeline/preprocess_sentinel2.py`
    *   `python scripts/lidar_pipeline/acquire_lidar.py` (if LiDAR URLs are provided in config)
    *   `python scripts/lidar_pipeline/preprocess_lidar.py`
    *   `python scripts/text_pipeline/acquire_texts.py`
    *   `python scripts/text_pipeline/preprocess_texts.py`
    *   *(Ensure `data/raw` and `data/processed` subdirectories are created as per script outputs, or provide sample processed data if raw acquisition is too lengthy for reproduction testing).*
5.  **Run EDA & PIZ Identification Notebooks (from the `notebooks/` directory):**
    *   Execute Jupyter Notebooks in the following order (as outputs from earlier notebooks may be inputs to later ones, conceptually):
        1.  `lidar_eda.ipynb`
        2.  `satellite_eda.ipynb`
        3.  `textual_eda_openai.ipynb`
        4.  `piz_identification_scoring.ipynb`
    *   Notebooks will generate visualizations and intermediate files in `eda_outputs/`. The `piz_identification_scoring.ipynb` will produce ranked PIZ lists (e.g., GeoJSON/CSV).
6.  **Review Outputs:** Check `eda_outputs/` and the PIZ files. The final PIZ list and example dossier content are key outputs.

*   **Expected Outputs:** Log files in `logs/`, processed data in `data/processed/`, EDA visualizations in `eda_outputs/`, ranked PIZs from `piz_identification_scoring.ipynb`.
*   **Estimated Run Times:** *(To be provided based on processing the example AOI/data sample).*

### 9.4. Manual Steps or Configurations
*   **API Key Setup:** User must obtain and configure their own OpenAI API key and Copernicus Hub (or PEPS) credentials.
*   **AOI Definition:** For a new AOI, users must update the `aoi_bbox` or `aoi_geojson_path` in `config.ini`.
*   **Data URLs:** For LiDAR and Textual data, URLs in `config.ini` must point to valid, accessible sources. If these sources change or become unavailable, the acquisition scripts for those data types will fail.
*   **PDAL Pipeline Parameters:** Default PDAL pipeline parameters for ground classification in `config.ini` are examples. Users may need to tune these for optimal DTM generation based on the characteristics of their specific LiDAR data.
*   **Tesseract OCR Installation:** If OCR for PDFs is used, Tesseract OCR engine and its language packs must be installed system-wide and accessible, or `tesseract_cmd_path` configured. Poppler utilities are also needed for `pdf2image`.

## 10. Conclusion (Initial Draft)

This project has outlined and implemented a comprehensive, AI-augmented framework for identifying and prioritizing Potential Interest Zones (PIZs) for archaeological research in the Amazon. By systematically integrating LiDAR, satellite imagery, and textual data, and leveraging AI for tasks ranging from text analysis to evidence synthesis, the methodology provides a powerful and reproducible approach to remote archaeological prospection in a challenging environment. The heuristic scoring system offers a transparent way to rank candidate sites, and the conceptual integration of OpenAI models for plausibility assessment adds a novel dimension to interpreting complex evidence. While this report details the framework and illustrative examples, the application of this system to real-world data holds the potential to significantly advance our understanding of Amazonian pre-Columbian societies by pinpointing new areas for detailed investigation.
